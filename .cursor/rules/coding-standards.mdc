# NeMo Curator Coding Standards

## Linting and Formatting

The project uses **Ruff** for linting and formatting with line length of 119 characters.

## Key Style Rules

### Allowed Patterns

- ✅ Print statements (T20 ignored)
- ✅ Boolean arguments in functions (FBT ignored)
- ✅ `df` as variable name for DataFrames (PD901 ignored)
- ✅ TODOs without author/link (TD002, TD003 ignored)
- ✅ Long exception messages (TRY003 ignored)
- ✅ Accessing private attributes (SLF001 ignored)
- ✅ Branching after return (RET505-508 ignored)

### Required Patterns

- ❌ No docstrings required (D ignored)
- ❌ No pathlib enforcement (PTH ignored)
- ❌ No logging enforcement (G ignored)
- ✅ Type annotations for functions (except `*args`, `**kwargs`, special methods)

## File-Specific Exceptions

### `examples/` directory
- No `__init__.py` required (INP001)

### `tests/` directory
- Allow assertions (S101)
- Allow magic values (PLR2004)
- No return type annotations required (ANN201)

### `tutorials/` directory
- No `__init__.py` required (INP001)
- Ignore Unicode complaint (PLE2515)

## Python Version Support

Supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 (requires >=3.10, <3.13)

## Loguru

NeMo Curator uses loguru for logging:

```python
from loguru import logger
```

Common uses include `logger.info`, `logger.warning`, and `logger.error`.

## PyTest Standards

All changes to NeMo Curator's source code must be accompanied with relevant tests. Tests which require a GPU and cannot be run on a CPU-only machine must be marked with `@pytest.mark.gpu`.

NeMo Curator enforces 80% PyTest coverage within the `nemo_curator/` directory.

For straightforward navigation purposes, the `tests/` directory structure matches the `nemo_curator/` directory structure.
